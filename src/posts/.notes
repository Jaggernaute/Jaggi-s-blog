I only compiled a few video essays and some papers I found interesting and that
reinforced an opinion I have on the subject\ldots
I don't claim to be an information source and what I just send is clearly biased
but with all the "discussions" I had with so called "vibe coders" and other LLM
aficionados, I'm still waiting to ear an argument that actually hold water to
justify using LLMs knowing it's downsides I'm still for the most part someone who loves science ...
and one of the most beautiful thing in science is when someone proves you wrong ...
the fact that someone cares enough about what you said and cares about the facts must
be respected and I can't wait for the day someone will tell me that AI doesn't impact critical
thinking, there's no security issues, no impact on human performance when relying on those tools,
no environmental impacts or no ethics problems for using it ...
but for now I'm yet to see something that weight as much or greater than the problems cited in the first message ...
